		<p>The fourth painting, Destruction, has almost the same perspective as the third, 
		   though the artist has stepped back a bit to allow a wider scene of the action, 
		   and moved almost to the center of the river. The action is the sack and destruction 
		   of the city, in the course of a tempest seen in the distance. It seems that a fleet 
		   of enemy warriors has overthrown the city's defenses, sailed up the river, and is 
		   busy ransacking the city and killing its inhabitants and raping women. The 
		   bridge across which the triumphant procession had crossed is broken; a makeshift 
		   crossing strains under the weight of soldiers and refugees. Columns are broken, and 
		   fire breaks from the upper floors of a palace on the river bank.
